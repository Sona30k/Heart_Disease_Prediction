# Heart_Disease_Prediction

# ❤️ Heart Disease EDA Project

This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of a heart disease dataset to uncover key insights into the relationships between various health indicators and the likelihood of having heart disease. Through effective **data visualization techniques**, we aim to understand patterns, distributions, and correlations between variables that influence heart health.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To analyze a heart disease dataset using **visualization tools** to:
- Understand the data distribution
- Explore trends and correlations
- Identify key factors associated with heart disease
- Gain insights for potential predictive modeling

---

## 📊 Visualizations Covered

A variety of visualization types are used to support comprehensive EDA:

- **Scatter Plots** – for relationships between numerical variables (e.g., age vs. cholesterol)
- **Line Plots** – for observing trends over time or sequences
- **Bar Plots** – for comparing categorical data (e.g., disease prevalence by age group)
- **Histograms** – for distribution of numerical variables (e.g., cholesterol levels)
- **Pie Charts** – for proportions in categorical columns
- **Violin Plots** – to visualize distributions and medians across groups
- **Heatmaps** – to visualize correlation matrices
- **PairPlots and JointPlots** – for multidimensional correlation exploration

## 🧪 Project Structure

This project is divided into **six parts**:

1. **Heart Disease EDA - Introduction to Kaggle**  
   Overview of the dataset and project goals.

2. **Heart Disease EDA - Age (DistPlot)**  
   Distribution of patient ages and its connection to heart disease.

3. **Heart Disease EDA - Categorical Columns (Pie Charts)**  
   Visualizing proportions of categories like sex, chest pain type, etc.

4. **Heart Disease EDA - ViolinPlot**  
   Examining distributions of features like cholesterol or restingBP across target classes.

5. **Heart Disease EDA - Correlation (HeatMap)**  
   Displaying pairwise feature correlations to detect strongest associations.

6. **Heart Disease EDA - Correlation (PairPlot & JointPlot)**  
   Deep-diving into specific relationships with advanced Seaborn plots.
